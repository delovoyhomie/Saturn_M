open,Step-by-step explanation for TON DNS subdomains system,"### Summary

An article describing how to work with subdomain resolvers, how to create and test tools like `resolve-contract.ton`.

As the subdomain resolver is rather interleaved with NFT searching code, this article might be better suited for blog than for documentation, however the either way I plan to maintain the good technical details level.

### Context

Currently, documentation does not feature how to build subdomain resolvers for TON DNS, and for existing resolvers (`auto-dns` and `manual-dns`) it only links to code, hindering technology adoption.

### Goals

- Create a detailed guide
- Publish it in TON Docs or TON Blog

### Deliverables

- Article with step-by-step explanation for TON DNS subdomains system and code of resolver contract `EQDkAbAZNb4uk-6pzTPDO2s0tXZweN-2R08T2Wy6Z3qzH_Zp`

open,IqraCrypto: Arabic Education Initiative,"### Summary

**Objective:**
Our goal is to make TON's groundbreaking technology accessible to the Arabic-speaking community by creating a series of educational courses. We aim to educate and empower this community with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand, use, and innovate on TON's platform.

Mena Region population: 480M
Mena Students: 110M
TON Arabic Content: nearly none


**About IqraCrypto:**
IqraCrypto is an educational platform that provides courses, guides, and resources about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. It aims to make blockchain education accessible to individuals from all backgrounds, with a particular focus on the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region.

**We have won grants from Ethereum Swarm, Stacks, Celo, Dfinity and UD.**

### Context

Blockchain and cryptocurrency are revolutionizing various sectors globally. However, a significant knowledge gap exists, particularly in non-English speaking regions like MENA. This project is a crucial step towards bridging that gap, making the revolutionary technology behind TON accessible to a vast, untapped Arabic-speaking audience. By doing so, we empower these individuals to not only understand and use TON but also to innovate upon it, contributing to the ecosystem's growth.


The purpose of this proposal is to teach the MENA Region in arabic the importance of TON  and how to use it. We will teach people how to build on TON sustainable projects and how they could impact the unbanked in the region.
If we estimate that only 0.0125% uses the platform or see the courses on the platform, that is 50 000 learners!

Considering the bear market, we estimate the learners will be less as people are less interested in crypto right now, but content will always be available anytime anywhere.

### Goals

A comprehensive and consistent workflow aimed at educating the Arabic-speaking community about TON and improving the ecosystem can follow the steps below:

**1- Content Research & Planning:** Research topics relevant to TON that are valuable to the Arabic-speaking community. These topics should include an introduction to TON, detailed guides on its use, technical details on building on TON, and specific use-cases. This process should involve developing a content calendar that maps out when each piece of content will be created and published.

**2- Content Creation:** Based on the topics identified, create a series of educational content in various formats such as:

- Articles and Guides: Write comprehensive and accessible blog posts and step-by-step guides on topics like understanding TON, using TON wallets, participating in TON's ecosystem, and developing on TON.

- Video Tutorials: Produce video content that visually guides viewers on how to navigate the TON ecosystem, with topics ranging from basic usage to advanced development.

- Documentation: Develop technical documentation that provides in-depth information about TON's technology and how to build on it.

**3- Translation:** Translate all content into Arabic to make it accessible to the target audience.

**4- Quality Assurance:** Review the content for accuracy, clarity, and relevance. Make necessary revisions to ensure it provides value and is easy to understand.

**5- Publication:** Publish the content on the IqraCrypto platform and any other relevant platforms where the Arabic-speaking community can access it.

**6- Promotion:** Promote the content across various channels, including social media, email newsletters, and through partnerships with other crypto communities in the MENA region.

**7- Community Engagement:** Engage with the community through forums, Q&A sessions, webinars, and workshops to answer queries and facilitate discussions around the TON ecosystem.

**8- Analytics & Reporting:** Monitor engagement metrics to track the effectiveness of the content. Use these insights to refine future content and strategies.

This workflow ensures that a steady stream of high-quality, relevant content is produced to educate the Arabic-speaking community about TON, thereby enhancing its ecosystem.

open,Python library to communicate with Liteservers using ADNL over TCP,"### Summary

Develop a Python library with [pytonlib](https://github.com/toncenter/pytonlib) features that communicates with LiteServers via ADNL over TCP, without using tonlibjson binaries.

### Context

Currently there are 2 pretty low level libraries for Python that get the Blockchain info using liteservers: 
* [psylopunk/pytonlib](https://github.com/psylopunk/pytonlib) (which is unfortunately abandoned)
* [toncenter/pytonlib](https://github.com/toncenter/pytonlib)

Libraries are good, but there is a huge problem: they use tonlib binaries. That's why you can have troubles with the libraries
if you use not popular OS, you should compile binaries and/or install openssl ver 1.1.1. (for example for Ubuntu 20 or 22 and Windows 10 you have to reinstall openssl or install libssl-dev). Also Libraries owners should update binaries regularly, for example there are old binaries in psylopunk/pytonlib so you cannot work with testnet right away and you have to compile/download new binaries.

I have found at least 13 reports from Python devs who wanted to develop in TON but encountered difficulties even at the point of **installing** one of these libraries:
https://t.me/tondev_eng/28015
https://t.me/tondev_eng/28395
https://t.me/tondev/116179
https://t.me/tondev/95849
https://t.me/tondev/80806

https://github.com/toncenter/pytonlib/issues/20
https://github.com/psylopunk/pytonlib/issues/30
https://github.com/psylopunk/pytonlib/issues/27

I spent only like 10 minutes for looking for complaints and a lot of newcomers don't even know about TON Dev chats so there are much more people who faced with this problem. 

So Python-TON community need this library to work with liteservers directly.

closed,Creation of a platform for checks (coupons),"### Summary

Development of a platform for checks (coupons) consisting of smart contracts, front-end and documentation.
The idea of checks is the following possibilities:
- creating a check for a certain amount
- attaching a check to a specific address
- creating a multicheck for several activations
- setting a password for the receipt

Case of using checks:
- user1 creates a check for 10 TON, assigns a password
- receives the qr code of the receipt activation transaction, and transfers it to the user2 (for example, by printing on paper)
- user2 scans the qr code, signs the transaction by specifying the password and receives 10 TON.
Thus, we have a semi-offline transmission of TON.

Checks can also be used for distribution to a large number of users.
  The main advantage is that all checks are available on the blockchain, unlike similar mechanics in other projects on the TON (cryptoBot)

### Context

_No response_

### Goals

- enable users to create checks securely on a smart contract
- enable semi-offline transactions of TON on smart contract

### Deliverables

Smart contract with the ability to create, delete, activate checks with parameters: set a password, bind to an address, number of activations. 
As well as a front-end on which you can conveniently use all the functionality through TON Connect 2.0

**Python** is one of the most popular programming languages and it is used both by beginners and advanced programmers.
In TON Python is convenient for parsing transactions, smart contracts, and generally working with blockchain. However, for beginners in TON it's difficult to start developing with Python, because there are much more tools and tutorials for developing with JS (TS), Go and other languages

### Goals

* Record easy-to-follow videos for international learners in English
* Make sure that the sound and video quality are good enough and comfortable for learners(do not contain any significant sound glitches).
* Reduce confusion and frustration for Python programmers who want to start developing in TON using their favorite language.
* Make a public playlist on the [TON Dev Study YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@WikiMar).
* Make a public repo on the [TON Dev Study GitHub page](https://github.com/TonDevStudy) with all code, written in videos.

### Deliverables

* Add a fresh and easy-to-understand live coding session on Python to work with TON to the course content. This will help us attract an international community of TON developers who are looking for simple and easy-to-understand video tutorials.
* 10 YouTube videos in course, 10 folders in GitHub repo with code and README in each folder

open,tontools and tonsdk python libraries development,"### Summary

[TonTools](https://github.com/yungwine/TonTools) is a popular high level python library, which allows to easily interact with ton using liteservers or apis (toncenter and tonapi currently)
[tonsdk](https://github.com/tonfactory/tonsdk) is a low level python library, there are a lot of utilities like tvm types, token (nft and ft), wallet contracts

The footstep is about continue contribute and develop this libraries 

### Context

**Python** is one of the most popular programming languages, but there is lack of libraries to use it with TON and lack of developers to create and contribute them. So python developers who come into TON ecosystem suffer from lack of tools to develop in TON with python. 

The main goal is to give them this ability and continue the development of the libraries.

### Goals

### tonsdk
* complete tvm types, such as add hashmaps parsing

closed,Tic Tac Toe in FunC with external messages,"### Summary
Create a tic-tac-toe game that will work entirely on a smart contract, mainly through external messages from players. As well as a web interface for communicating with the contract and signing transactions with the private key.


### Context
When I first started developing for TON, I really wanted to see how to work with external messages in FunC using a simple example, because it seemed to me that this topic was not developed as much as it had potential.
Many months have passed, and the situation has not changed much.
Also we want to make a convenient, responsive and fast game in which you can enjoy spending several tens of minutes with friends. If we manage to achieve this goal as well, it will be an indicator that TON is ready for game-fi.


### Goals
#### Basic
- First of all, the game should be technically interesting, as a simple example of receiving and sending external messages. Therefore, one of the main goals will be clear documentation and high-quality code.
-  **Basic Logic Description:**
The user enters the site, it generates him a keypair, and user has buttons for joining the game at the address of the contract and for creating a new game.
When creating, site generates a contract deployment message for the user, the user sends it. Now he has a game link that he can send to a friend to join. This link points to a page with the current tic-tac-toe field that the site receives in real time from the contract. At the end of the game, the winner can send the balance of the game contract to any address, much like a send request on a regular wallet. If the game ended in a draw, the first player (who deployed the contract) can send the rest of the TONs.
If desired, user can play without the UI, forming, signing and sending external messages through advanced tools.

#### Extended
> If we make the main goal not an example of working with external messages, but the creation of a cool interesting game.
- Develop a tic-tac-toe platform. Where it will be possible to create public games for random players with stakes in TON, extend games for revenge, play for jettons and so on.
- Ability to play 3D Tic Tac Toe.


### Deliverables
#### Basic
- A web page with an interface for creating new tic-tac-toe game session contracts and playing existing ones (with testnet version).
- Github repository with smart contract source code, tests (using [blueprint](https://github.com/ton-community/blueprint)) and React front-end.
#### Extended
- Platform for playing tic-tac-toe on smart contracts with the functionality described above.

open,TON Dev Study - Learn send_mode and fees through Sandbox tests.,"### Summary

This Footstep aims to create a guide that explains the behavior of message modes using Sandbox. The guide should cover topics such as bounces, transaction fees, and the possible directions of the message(internal, external out/inc). The guide should use tests as an example to demonstrate these concepts.

### Context

The guide is required because a lot of newcomers are still confused with messages and fees behavior and writing tests via Sandbox. 

For example, a developer may not know why their contract is failing when trying to send a message. By providing a guide that explains the behavior of message mode, users can more easily understand the underlying concepts and troubleshoot issues.
Additionally, these examples could serve as templates for newcomers learning how to write tests, and how to define their specific problems.


### Goals

- Improve developers' understanding of message modes.
- Provide clear examples using tests for Sandbox(for example, tests for wallet contracts).
- Reduce confusion and frustration for users when testing contracts.
- Examples should be accessible and easy to run in the local environment.


### Deliverables

* Explain to newcomers how messages and fees work with examples and Sandbox tests.
* Explanation of transaction fees for the TON developers community improved and clearer.
* docs.ton.org documentation could be improved with related guidelines and examples of tests and send_mode(s).


### Definition of Done

- [ ]  Demo repository with Sandbox tests for sending messages(send_mode, fees and bounces cases) created.
- [ ]  Video with a detailed explanation published in the TON Dev Study channel.

### Reward


* 1200$ in TON equivalent (300$ for the each video)
* Standard TON Footstep NFT.

open,Dart library for TON Connect 2.0,"### Summary

Our small team would like to create a library for working with the TON Connect 2.0 protocol in Dart.

### Context

Currently, there is no library available for working with the TON Connect protocol in the Dart ecosystem. One of the most common uses of Dart today is bulding cross-platform(one code for iPhone and Android) apps with Flutter framework. So the library will help cross-platform applications. The first version of the library, under which the grant is taken, assumes support http-bridge-compatible wallets. We also plan to provide necessary documentation to make new users onboarding process easier and quicker. We will post materials in dev.to, habr and [ton_learn](https://t.me/ton_learn), as well as Dart/Flutter communities.

### Goals

* Develop a library for working with the TON Connect in Dart
* Help Dart developers integrate TON Connect into dApps written in Dart (using Flatter)

open,EVM Rollup on TON Feasibility Study,"### Summary

This proposal aims to conduct a feasibility study exploring the potential of building an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Rollup on the The Open Network (TON). The study will investigate the TON infrastructure, smart contracts, and the necessary steps for implementing an EVM Rollup.

### Context

The integration of an EVM Rollup on TON would bridge the gap between Ethereum and TON, allowing developers to deploy and run Ethereum-compatible smart contracts on the TON blockchain. This would enable TON to leverage the thriving Ethereum ecosystem, attract more developers, and encourage new decentralized applications (dApps) to be built on its platform. A feasibility study is essential to outline a clear roadmap for the EVM Rollup's development and ensure that the project is well-planned, properly prioritized, and resource-efficient.

### Goals

1. Gain an in-depth understanding of the TON infrastructure and smart contracts
2. Explore existing Rollup solutions and their applicability to TON
3. Develop a comprehensive plan for the EVM Rollup implementation, including tech stack selection, timeline, and resource estimation

### Deliverables

1. A P2 proposal outlining high-level plans for the EVM Rollup implementation, including a whitepaper, architecture, budget, and timetable
2. Identification of components to be developed, such as the EVM Rollup client and smart contract execution environment
3. A list of challenges to overcome, such as the ZKVerifier on TON (if a ZK architecture is chosen), on-chain EVM simulator on TON (if an optimistic architecture is chosen), addressing account address differences between Ethereum and TON, and bridging TON tokens into the rollup.

### Definition of Done

The feasibility study is considered complete and successful when the P2 proposal is delivered, addressing all the aforementioned goals and deliverables, and providing a well-researched basis for deciding whether to proceed with the EVM Rollup implementation on TON.
We will provide a progress report every 2 week, in addition to the final deliverable above by the end of the period.

open,Dart/Flutter SDK for TON,"### Summary

The Dart language is primarily used alongside the Flutter framework to build natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. And it's best at making cross-platform mobile apps.

The ecosystem around this language can greatly benefit from a dedicated SDK to work with TON Blockchain, as there are many web3 developers who currently only interact with other blockchains for their apps. Developing this SDK will attract more developers to the TON ecosystem, expanding its reach and utility. This proposal outlines a development plan to create a comprehensive Dart/Flutter SDK for TON Blockchain.

### Context

At the moment there are no libraries to work with the TON blockchain using Dart/Flutter. To address this problem, the following features are planned to be developed as a part of the footstep:

- Implement Cell, Slice, Builder, and BOC (de)serialization
- Implement an RPC client to work with the TON network
- Implement support for popular structures from block.tlb
- Implement support of TON base64 addresses
- Implement support of HashmapE
- Implement support of TON & BIP39 Mnemonics
- Implement support of wallets (v3, v3r2, v4r2)
- Implement Ed25519 signing of transactions
- Implement for workings with Jettons and NFTs

### Goals

- Develop the Dart/Flutter SDK to work with the TON blockchain
- Provide the necessary documentation for quickly getting started with the SDK
- Continue maintaining the SDK after reaching the abovementioned goals

### Deliverables

- GitHub repository with Dart/Flutter SDK and examples of its usage
- Publicly available package on pub.dev for Dart/Flutter community to use
- Small video series of concrete and clear tutorials on real-world usage of the SDK

closed,Telegram Web Apps low level communication library,"### Summary

This proposal is mostly related to making core Telegram Web Apps library more public and transparent. The result of proposal is some GitHub repository with a library which allows developers to use it as a base for their own SDK or other libraries.

### Context

**New update, new problems**

The recent Telegram update brought us some new feature related to Telegram Web Apps - users are now allowed to open web applications directly. This update allowed developers to stop redirecting user to their bot and open application directly, but it also brought some new problem. 

This became easier for attackers to deceive people and send them the links of fake bots. So, previously, an attacker had to create a fake bot and then, a fake application. Now, he can just make a copy of some application and send it to user, or just **insert a frame of other application** and try to abuse its vulnerabilities.

**What vulnerabilities?**

This is the second point, why this proposal is important. On the official Telegram's site in sections related to Telegram Web Apps, there is a section named [`Initializing Web Apps`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#initializing-web-apps), where Telegram developers offer the external developers to use their JavaScript file [`telegram-web-app.js`](https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js).

Spending some time to research the offered file, I've made some conclusions:

1. We need this file to be placed in some public source. It could be GitHub, for example. This will allow external developers to track file changes to know what changes to the file were done;
2. There is a code, which seems to be kept for testing purposes:
```
Line 140: // For now we don't restrict target, for testing purposes
Line 141: trustedTarget = '*'
```
**This code disables security mechanism to prevent sending data to untrusted targets**;

3. There is a code which seems to be not reached in default applications. For example, there is a code related to some launch parameter `tgWebAppDebug` which is not described anywhere. In this JavaScript file, this parameter is responsible for logging additional messages and replacing Telegram Web Apps `MainButton` component, which seems strange. Looks like it is some debug code for some specific developers;
4. Telegram's script does not validate the origin of parent iframe when receiving and processing events. This also opens a new door for the attacker;
5. We need this file to be a npm package, which could be installed and used;
6. We need this file to be written with the usage of TypeScript as long as a developer will have to find TypeScript typings by himself then.
7. The developers **community** can make this code more clear, faster and optimized.

**Conclusion**

We are not able to save all users from fraud, but we could make the life of attackers way harder by enabling all security features we can. We should also include the community vision on how the libraries of such type should be developed, as long as they are provided for community.

### Goals

- Create a public GitHub repository containing created library source code. The language of the library is TypeScript;
- Create a public npm package ready for production
- Create a detailed documentation on how library works and why the solutions made in the library could seem strange (in case they are)

- Public npm package
- Public GitHub repository with source code
- Library documentation

open,Ton Developers Program: Footsteps,"### Summary

The two footsteps covered in this technical specification are:

- **Backend and Frontend Development for Users and Admin Panel**: This step involves creating a robust backend and frontend system that caters to the needs of both users and administrators. It includes the development of user profiles, developer rankings, hackathon and event integration, and bot integration for users. The admin panel will focus on user management, SBT token management, activity and achievement management, notification management, and reporting and analytics.
- **Bot Development and SBT Minting System**: This step focuses on building a versatile bot that handles user registration, account management, notifications, and integration with the Ton Developers Program system. Additionally, it involves the development of the SBT minting system, which will be integrated into the existing admin panel. This system will allow authorized users to mint SBT tokens for various activities and events, working seamlessly with the existing features of the admin panel and providing a user-friendly interface for managing the minting process.

These two footsteps aim to create a comprehensive system that supports the Ton Developers Program by motivating developers to actively participate in the TON ecosystem and providing an efficient, secure, and accessible platform for managing users, SBT tokens, and related activities.

The development of a comprehensive backend and frontend system for users, the admin panel is crucial for the Ton Developers Program System. This footstep aims to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for developers, trusted activists, and other users interacting with the platform, while ensuring security, scalability, and performance.

The development of a Ton Developers Program Bot and SBT Minting System is crucial for the Ton Developers Program, as it will provide a seamless way to reward and engage developers within the community. By creating a bot for handling user registration, notifications, and rankings, along with a secure and user-friendly minting system, developers will be encouraged to actively participate and contribute to the TON ecosystem.

closed,Access control via NFT and SBT,"### Summary

This TON Footstep proposal aims to create a decentralized solution for renting and borrowing NFTs and SBTs to facilitate access management in organizations or companies. The solution will consist of a smart contract and a Telegram bot that allows administrators to set up the rental parameters and manage access to specific chats or channels for a limited time.

### Context

Currently, organizations and companies need a flexible and secure way to grant temporary access to their employees for specific chats and channels. With the growing popularity of NFTs and SBTs in access management, there is a need for a system that allows administrators to rent and borrow these tokens to manage user access to different resources within their organization. This proposal aims to address this need by developing a smart contract and Telegram bot that can automate the process of renting and borrowing NFTs and SBTs.

### Goals

* Develop a smart contract to manage the renting and borrowing of NFTs and SBTs.
* Create a Telegram bot to interact with the smart contract, enabling administrators to set up rental parameters and manage user access.

Right now is it a problem for organizers to create NFT awards for various events. They have to turn to third-party developers to solve this problem. Our task is to make solution, that will automates process of minting new SBT-awards!

### Goals

We need to create a telegram bot, with such flows:

New collection flow:
- Bot asks user to upload the cover image 
- Bot asks user to upload the collection image
- Bot asks user to enter the collection name
- Bot asks user to enter the collection description
- Bot asks user to enter the item name (it will be the same for all items + #index)
- Bot asks user to enter the item description
- Bot asks user to upload the item image (image property in NFT metadata)
- Bot asks user to upload a file containing addresses (separated by newlines) that should receive NFTs
- Bot uploads images to storage, creates collection and item manifests and uploads them, then creates a ton:// link that send necessary amount of TON to wallet of the telegram bot. Upon receipt of funds the wallet begins to mint SBT items

Existing collection flow:
- Bot asks user to enter the existing collection address
- Bot checks if the collection exists and is compatible with the bot
- Bot shows how the previous batch of items was minted (name, description, image), asks the user if the items should stay the same
- If not, bot asks the user to enter new item name, new item description, and new item image
- Bot asks user to upload a file containing addresses (separated by newlines) that should receive NFTs
- Bot uploads item image to storage (if it was changed), creates item manifest (if any item properties were changed) and uploads it, then creates a ton:// link that will send necessary amount of TON to the wallet of the telegram bot. Which, in turn, begins to mint new items.

Superadmin flow:
- /add - add new admin, that will be able to use bot
- /list - see all admins of the bot
- /delete - delete an admin by his ID

Use s3 as file storage(that will be paid by TON Foundation)

closed,Full guide with explanations on Sandbox,"### Summary

This proposal is aimed at creating detailed and understandable documentation (maybe guide) for Sandbox for beginners.

 * https://github.com/ton-community/sandbox

### Context

Sandbox is a great tool that has significantly accelerated and simplified the testing of smart contracts in TON.
But it doesn't have enough documentation yet, apart from a README, which is not very clear to beginners.

I gave my friends, who knew almost nothing about how smart contracts work in TON, the opportunity to figure out the Sandbox & Blueprint on their own. As a result, they had a lot of questions to which they could not find a clear answer.

In addition to questions about specific things and functions, it was difficult for them to understand the meaning of wrappers and some other mechanics.

### Goals

 * Write a clear and accessible explanation (in the format of documentation or guide) of all things from Sandbox

### Deliverables

 * Make the process of onboarding in writing smart contracts and tests for them as comfortable and simple as possible

### Definition of Done

 * [ ] Guide/Documentation is completed and easily available for newcomers

### Reward

 * Standard TON Footstep NFT

Develop a framework that allows developers to build custom indexers for the needs of their applications. The framework should be simple and flexible, allowing developers to create their own logic to process TON blockchain data in their preferred programming language. The framework should also be reliable and cost-effective, utilizing Amazon S3 as a data source.
If you want to know more, I recommend you check out https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/near-lake-framework.

### Context

Currently, developers who want to build custom indexers for the TON blockchain have limited options. They can run a full node, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming to maintain. Alternatively, they can use services like TON HTTP API, which are limited for use in production.  
To address these issues, the TON Lake Framework aims to provide a solution for building indexers on S3, making it a cost-effective and flexible alternative to running a full node or relying on services like TON HTTP API.</p><p>Comparison with Full Node and Services (e.g TON HTTP API):

open,Contract storing TEP text in blockchain,"### Summary

This proposal suggests storing TON Enhancement Proposals (TEPs) text in a contract on the masterchain.

### Context

Storing TEPs in a contract on the masterchain would provide several benefits. It would improve TEPs accessibility in case Github is overloaded or decides not to support TON. Also, there is a suggestion to store jetton wallets' code as shared library, and this proposal is generalization of that idea.

### Goals

Create the contract that would store the TEP's index, documentation text, API for interacting with TEP-compliant contracts in the form of a shared library, a template of an exotic cell for loading that library, and editors' addresses or public keys. The contract should also store the address of the owner, who would be the only one able to add new TEPs.

### Deliverables

- [ ] Develop a contract described above
- [ ] Deploy and test contract in testnet
- [ ] Create UI
- [ ] Create TEP (:grinning:) describing the contract
- [ ] Deploy contract in mainnet with editorship assigned to TON Foundation
- [ ] Migrate existing TEPs to the contract

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Contract created
- [ ] UI created
- [ ] Contract deployed in mainnet
- [ ] Existing TEPs migrated

I would like to make a tutorial on https://github.com/ton-core/ton-lite-client library.

### Context

To create simple applications and MVPs on TON, you need to make requests to smart contracts (at least get methods). Popular ts/js libraries and tutorials suggest using intermediaries (https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb). Also, such libraries require an API key, which makes it dangerous to use them on the frontend. At the same time, there is a library (https://github.com/ton-core/ton-lite-client) that uses adnl, but I have not seen tutorials on it and there is no documentation either.Therefore, I would like to write tutorials on basic things.

closed,Example of a secure application that uses TonConnect 2.0 and TonProof with a backend partially on Ruby on Rails,"### Summary

This step proposes to explain how the examples  <https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-backend> and <https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-with-backend> work, how you can test them in a local environment and how to safely expand them to implement most of your backend in a different programming language (Ruby on Rails in the case of the article, but you can adapt to your preferred back-end language and framework). We further propose to keep the example running on a server provided by the author during 15 days.

The approach of this footstep of having two backends, is not trivial when it considers security,  because the authentication on the Ruby backend needs to decrypt  the JWT (JSON Web Token) generated by the first backend in go.  Both backends must be coordinated with a secure way to generate/use safe JWTs, and for that the first backend in go must be improved to generate JWTs hard to decrypt except for the Ruby backend that also needs cryptographic tools.


### Context

If you are developing an application with a back-end in your preferred programming language and framework (for example, python, node.js, Ruby on Rails), you may find it very difficult to authenticate with TonConnect 2.0 because:

1. There is only one Backend example available in the ""go"" language <https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-backend> and it's not that easy to understand what it does.  Even after understanding it, translating it to a different programming language can be hard, because it requires specific cryptographic tools  and a data structure with mutexes to keep the checked wallets that used the backend recently.
2. The corresponding Typescript frontend is at <https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-with-backend> but it's also not easy to understand how it interacts with the backend.


### Goals

Assist Hack-a-tonx 2023 participants as well as TON application developers that require a backend, TonConnect 2.0 authentication on the frontend, and transaction security.

### Deliverables

* An article about how the <https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-backend> and <https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-with-backend> examples work , how to deploy them locally, how to change the backend of the example, and  how to securely connect them to a second backend in a different programming language and framework.
* The github repository with the sourcecode of a full example including: first backend in go patched,  second backend in Ruby on Rails, frontend patched to use first backend for checking proof of wallet and generating JWT, and using the second backend to do other requests but authenticated with JWT generated by first backed and  instructions to deploy it locally coordinating both backends to generate/use secure JWT.
* The previous example operating on a server provided by the author during 10 days.

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Section that explains how the backend in ""go"" works,  how to deploy it locally, and how to configure it with environment variables.
- [ ] Section that explains how the frontend works, how to deploy it locally, how to change it to use the backend deployed by you.
- [ ] Section with screenshots detailing for each operation in the frontend how the information flows between the frontend and backend with HTTP requests and responses.
- [ ] Section that explains how to modify the backend and the frontend to interact with a second backend in a completely different language/framework while maintaining secure communications and transactions between the frontend and the new backend after the initial authentication with the first backend.  The second backend is exemplified with a Ruby on Rails implementation. The details of how to produce secure JWTs with the first backend, that can be decrypted practically only by the second backend is given along with the cryptographic tools required in the second backend.
- [ ] Repository with a working example including modified frontend, modified first backend, second backend in Ruby on Rails and starting script.
- [ ] Example operating during 10 days on a server provided by the author

closed,Massive sender bot & contract,"### Summary

Bot that sends toncoins to several addresses using smart contract

### Context

The bot and smart contract is needed to simplify massive sending. Usages are:
 - Rewards for ton competitions
 - Payments for investors

### Goals

The bot should accept json file that contains a dictionary from address to number of toncoins to send to this address

JSON example
```
{
    ""EQDk0rRqwtKw34r0fecUO6YotwKfMPU9XIxwrfjOfX9BIUx_"": ""52"",
    ""EQBnk2PqeZZjIya2zvPlH2pnSQYYPjNReMntiOyWYt9au_fc"": ""34"",
    ""EQCafuKP6EVcOo_ZifdIBfE1EwM1QPFj_-ryaT0IY6CNRVtV"": ""100""
}
```

CSV example:
```
""EQDk0rRqwtKw34r0fecUO6YotwKfMPU9XIxwrfjOfX9BIUx_"",52
""EQBnk2PqeZZjIya2zvPlH2pnSQYYPjNReMntiOyWYt9au_fc"",34
""EQCafuKP6EVcOo_ZifdIBfE1EwM1QPFj_-ryaT0IY6CNRVtV"",100
```

TG message example:
```
EQDk0rRqwtKw34r0fecUO6YotwKfMPU9XIxwrfjOfX9BIUx_: 52
EQBnk2PqeZZjIya2zvPlH2pnSQYYPjNReMntiOyWYt9au_fc: 34
EQCafuKP6EVcOo_ZifdIBfE1EwM1QPFj_-ryaT0IY6CNRVtV: 100
```

User needs to connect to the bot via ton connect 2.0 with tonkeeper.
Then they need to provide the file with description of addresses and number of tons to send for each address. 
After that they should approve transaction to send toncoins from their wallet to smart contract. 
Smart contract will send the coins to addresses from file. 

Other details:
 - Smart contract should recursively send all messages in chunks of length 254 if there are too many of them
 - Smart contract should be deployed with addresses and amounts in data
 - 0.1 ton will be added for each address for gas. The remaining amount will be returned to sender



Smart contract language: Func
Tests will be on: blueprint & sandbox

The Open Network Web Archive is an educational-service provider providing tutorials and storage services for static website contents on TON.

There're people, e.g. @lorrodx in tondev_eng Telegram channel who were confused with how to get a Bag ID, use the Bag ID to generate a storage request with a storage provider, and use the storage request to create a storage contract with the storage provider on their own storage.

This led a question to me: do I need to create an article explaining how to create a storage contract with a storage provider, in more general and common way, regardless of storage providers, while referring the tutorials written on The Open Network Web Archive Journey `0x107c49ef`, or http://webarchive.ton/journey/0x107c49ef?

The storage contract creation hands-on article will cover how to look for or deploy a storage provider, get a Bag ID from files, generate storage request with a trusted/deployed storage provider from the Bag ID, and create storage contracts with the provider, in a no-harassment way.

### Context

_No response_

### Goals

Providing people with the knowledge of how to generate and create:

* Bag IDs from files.
* Storage requests from Bag IDs with storage providers.
* Storage contracts from storage requests with storage providers.

The Article will cover:

* How to look for or deploy a storage provider?
* Ways to generate Bag IDs from files.
* Use the Bag IDs to generate storage requests with storage providers and check the provider's storage rate.
* Create storage contracts with the selected storage providers.
* Balances on the storage contracts and deposit to them.

closed,NFT Edition minter and Tact contracts showcase,"### Summary

Provide a user-friendly way to mint NFT editions like it does [Jetton Minter ](https://minter.ton.org/). Along with this, show the first production-ready example of contracts Tact lang.

### Context

There are several ways to mint an NFT collection, for example using [Getgems](https://getgems.helpscoutdocs.com/article/24-how-can-i-add-my-collection-to-getgems) which is relatively user-friendly. Still, it gives you little control over what you can customize, or you can use [Ton Nft Deployer](https://tondiamonds.github.io/ton-nft-deployer/) it's it has more customization, but at the expense of usability for users and newcomers.  

However, no one offers a useful way to mint NFT editions that can be used to mint NFT tickets, burn-reveal mechanics or such crazy art as the Checks [[1](https://checks.art/)][[2](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1611726527590187016)]. 

NFT edition [[eth reference](https://create.zora.co/create/edition)]:
- Same Media for each NFT
- Limited mint by time or number of edits  
- Limits for mint per address
- Fixed price for the initial offer (can be free) 

I offer to provide users NFT edition minter which combines usability and customization. I hope this enables the community and creators more focus on interesting mechanics and art, but not the technology itself. 

### Goals

* Provide NFT edition contract implementation on Tact сompatible with TEP-62
* Provide easy-to-use UI to interact with NFT Edition Minter

[Tact Cookbook](https://docs.tact-lang.org/learn/cookbook) should help quickly figure out basic steps for implementing the most frequent logic in contracts, even if seekers have no experience with smart contracts or FunC development.

### Context

Tact is in active development right now, and many methods are subject to change. It is important to publish what can already be considered unchanged.

### Goals

Examples and descriptions of logic implementation should help with the following issues:
* People who really don't have the opportunity to read well-detailed explanations in articles but really want to know something simple and basic. These questions are good to be answered in short form.
* Sometimes we get questions that have already been well answered a hundred times, but it's hard to find original answers in history or write good answers quickly.


### Deliverables

Tact Cookbook should help quickly answer the most frequent questions about implementing logic in contracts.

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Most frequent questions about ""How to [logic in the contract] with Tact?"" could be answered with a link to the [Tact cookbook](https://docs.tact-lang.org/learn/cookbook).

open,Smart-contracts for jetton voting platform,"### Summary

The increasing popularity of defi applications and services using jettons has brought about new challenges for users and developers.
These challenges include the potential for loss of funds and reputation as a result of the uncontrolled use of jettons. It can often be difficult to distinguish between legitimate jettons and those created by scammers. Currently, there is no definitive whitelist of jettons, and no transparent process for creating such a whitelist.

To solve these challenges, we propose the development of a decentralized mechanism for verifying jettons through community voting and creating a status of jettons.

This decentralized mechanism would provide a transparent voting process and give equal rights of review to any jetton. The model would be driven by the community and all data would be stored in smart contracts. Additionally, any project would be able to proof a jetton by address through direct interaction with SDK.

The new approach to obtaining trusted addresses works like quasi-DAO is poised to be a game-changing ecosystem solution for the entire TON blockchain network. By building an entirely new jetton verification process that will become an ecosystem standard, developers, projects, and users will have access to a more secure and trustworthy network.

The design and architecture of smart-contracts based on proposals will ensure that a decentralized application is created for all participants of the TON ecosystem. This will provide developers, projects, and users with a more seamless and user-friendly experience.

In addition, the decentralized application that allows the community to make address verification transparent and available to each project will provide a significant benefit to the entire network. This will ensure that all projects have access to a tool for instant verification of any address, making the network more secure and transparent.

Overall, new approach to verified addresses is a significant step forward for the TON blockchain network. It will provide a more secure, trustworthy, and user-friendly experience for all participants of the ecosystem, making it an ecosystem solution for the entire network.

### Context

The jetton voting platform allows users to see the whitelist of jettons, create, change, and participate in the voting process.

In this concept, after voting, each jetton has two types of votes:

- whitelisted
- not whitelisted

By the ratio of the number of votes, we can conclude about the confidence of the voting community in the possibility of using the jetton in services.

By default, a defined number of users would be able to participate in the voting process, with the possibility of expanding this list.

Each user would have the ability to change their vote over time, resulting in a changeable status for the token. In the future, it is proposed to use a web application for organizing voting, which will be developed with the next footstep.

This footstep applies only to the development of smart contracts and API.

### Goals

- Develop design and architecture for on-chain mechanic of jetton voting platform
- Develop smart-contracts for future web application
- Develop tests for smart-contracts
- Tests voting platform core 
- Our next goal is web application and SDK for jetton voting platform

""How to work with smart wallet contracts"" tutorial creation.

### Context

Currently, there is no detailed tutorial on working with smart wallet contracts, creating transactions, signing, and sending them. There are also no clear examples of the external/internal transaction difference and how wallets generally work. This tutorial will cover all such moments and will also touch on the topic of high-load wallets.

### Goals

- First, the tutorial will explain seqno, valid_until, and signature and why all this is stored in the contract memory

- There will also be a detailed explanation of the need for two types of transactions (external/internal), as well as the difference between v3 and v4.

- More will be told about external and why smart wallet contracts accept these transactions. 

- How to build an external transaction, sign it (without using ready-made methods in existing libraries to understand the process fully), and send it. The main job will be with ton & ton-crypto for JS/TS and tonutils-go for GO.

- The next stage will be the explanation of wallets, stateInit building, mnemonic phrase generation, and other details related to the creation of the wallet. All this will be based on examples with the description of the code.

- Next will be the stage of working with smart contract wallet: sending TONs, transactions with comments, GET methods. Also, special attention will be paid to building transactions within the contract for deploying new smart contracts.

- The last step will be related to high-load wallets and how they differ from the usual wallets.

Many examples will be shown based on libraries ton (JS/TS) and tonutils-go (GO).

open,Make formal verification accessible for anyone,"### Summary

Currently, formal verification is mostly done by auditing companies, such as Certik / SlowMist / etc.
But price of audit is not that small for developers building their own projects, and that leads to loss of contract verification -- only testing on *some* cases is done.

### Context

TON Foundation has recently passed audit on Certik and on SlowMist. Source COQ codes for formal verification are not published. Having those in public could help the community.

### Goals

Create a library for verification of smart contracts under some permissive license (like MIT).

### Deliverables

1. Choose language for verification (Idris/Coq/etc)
2. Reimplement TON Blockchain details and objects on high level in chosen language (up to smart contracts and message processing)
3. Implement TVM, BOC operations to allow FunC/TVM assembly to be literally translated into chosen language, to reduce errors where contract actual code does not match its formal version
4. Create a manual including some contract with error which needs to be found, its formal description, verification failure and then fixed contract which passes verification.

### Definition of Done

- [ ] High-level library created
- [ ] Low-level library created
- [ ] Example contract successfully verified
- [ ] Manual for verification published in documentation

open,Article: Porting the TON tools to OpenBSD/adJ,"### Summary

The article should describe how the TON tools, i.e <https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton>, were ported to the operating system OpenBSD/adJ allowing development of smart contracts on that system --as described in <https://medium.com/@vladimirtmara/developing-and-testing-a-simple-smart-contract-with-toncli-de96ad0a6f5c>

It also should present the current status of the porting effort of `mytonctrl` and serve as documentation for people wanting to run different kind of nodes on OpenBSD/adJ.

### Context

Using the TON tools on OpenBSD/adJ increases their security, because OpenBSD is number one OS in security (see <https://www.openbsd.org/security.html>) and has a better record of vulnerabilites discovered than Windows, Linux, Mac, FreeBSD, etc (you can compare searching at <https://www.cvedetails.com/google-search-results.php?q=openbsd>). The distribution adJ adds to OpenBSD the support for locale and xlocale, that in turn is required by modern C++ compilers and by libraries used by TON tools like `abseil-cpp`.

Porting the basic TON tools to OpenBSD/adJ was not a trivial task, because it required changes to the Operating System, to the library `abseil-cpp` and even to the TON tools.  Those changes were proposed and accepted by the upstream developers, see for example:
<https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/commit/f7041cb44ff57a56894a312ba2fdc8058ccfc6e6>



### Goals

* Describe how the porting was done and the resulitng organization of the port, that can be reference to improve the main TON tools or to port them to other OS.
* Describe the source code of the TON tools (there is no  documentation about it).
*  Present the current status of the porting effort of mytonctrl in order to run possible validator or collator nodes on OpenBSD/adJ.

### Deliverables

* An article published in medium.com and dev.to
* Article shared in twitter, linked.in and facebook

open,Creating a FunC Language Track on Exercism.org,"### Summary

This project is about creating a FunC language track on Exercism, an open-source code-academy-like platform. The project will involve creating a FunC language repository, a test runner, and a first lesson on the [Exercism platform](https://exercism.org/) which supports 62 languages. Let's add FunC as 63rd!

### Context

Exercism is an open-source platform that provides users with code tutorials in various development languages.

* Platform: https://exercism.org/
* GitHub organization: https://github.com/exercism

Currently, it does not provide tutorials for the FunC language, which is used to write smart contracts on the TON Blockchain. To remedy this situation, you could create a FunC language track on Exercism with a first lesson “Hello World” hosted on the platform.

#### Example

 You can use the Rust language track for inspiration.

- Here is an example of a Rust language track:
https://exercism.org/tracks/rust
- Here is an example of a GitHub repository for Rust language:
https://github.com/exercism/rust
- Here is an example of a GitHub repository for checking Rust solutions for validity (test runner):

closed,Article: Random numbers generation in blocks,"### Summary

We need a low-level article which explains how validators produce random numbers which are used as block seeds.

### Context

Currently, way of generating random seeds is unclear even from TON whitepapers. This raises questions whether those seeds are generated before or after deciding which external messages are imported, and that makes it unclear whether insidious (but still fair) validator can include an external message into block generating exactly needed random value.

This article may possibly start series ""Writing own tools for interacting with TON"".

### Goals

- Make it clear how random block seeds are generated

### Deliverables

- Article describing process of generating block seed (whitepapers mention threshold signatures - if this is actually used, it needs a description understandable at least by developers)

This document outlines the requirements for a bug bounty program of the TON Blockchain Multisig smart contract. The bug bounty program will help assess the current level of security and suggest improvements to enhance its safety by TON Community.

### Context

The TON Blockchain Multisig Smart-Contract is a critical component of the TON Blockchain platform, responsible for securely handling transactions and protecting user funds. As such, it is essential that it be subjected to a rigorous security audit to ensure that it is secure and reliable. 

Here is a codebase of a multi-sig smart contract:
* https://github.com/ton-blockchain/multisig-contract

Currently, there has been no security audit performed on the TON Blockchain Multisig Smart-Contract, leaving its safety and reliability unknown. By conducting a bug bounty program, we can ensure that multi-sig meets the highest security and reliability standards proven by the community.


### Goals

* This project aims to conduct an independent security audit of the TON Blockchain Multisig Smart-Contract by anyone from the TON Community in the form of a ""Bug Bounty"" program.

### Deliverables

* Bugs found, and a reward has been paid to members of the TON Community

closed,Create a User-Friendly Config for TON Blockchain,"### Summary

This project aims to create a user-friendly web dashboard that will allow users to better understand the technical parameters of the TON Blockchain config.

### Context

The TON Ecosystem has a complex config with many technical parameters. However, only a small amount of people understand what these parameters mean. This project is necessary to provide users with an easy way to understand the parameters and their purpose.

In this way, we would make Blockchain technology easier to understand for newcomers.

## Example

open,Alt-bn128 curve func implementation,"### Summary

Alt_bn128 is an elliptic curve used in other blockchains. It is defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 3 over a finite field of prime order, which means that the points on the curve satisfy this equation. The curve has some special properties that make it well-suited for use in cryptography.

Another important property of alt_bn128 is that it is resistant to certain types of attacks. For example, it is resistant to a type of attack known as the ""elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem,"" which is a potential weakness in some other types of curves.

Overall, alt_bn128 is a well-studied and widely used curve in the field of cryptography, and it has proven to be a reliable and secure choice for use in the TON blockchain.

### Context

Elliptic curves, such as alt_bn128, are used in cryptography for various purposes, including for creating digital signatures and for implementing key exchange protocols. In the context of the Ethereum blockchain, alt_bn128 is used to perform a specific type of calculation known as an ""elliptic curve pairing,"" which is a key component of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The EVM is the runtime environment in which smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are executed. The elliptic curve pairing calculation is used in the EVM to verify the validity of transactions and to enforce certain properties of smart contracts.

This project aims to create a Telegram Bot to share every new post from the [TON Overflow](https://answers.ton.org/ ) to the developer community chats (TonDev Chats RU, EN, CN).

### Context

TonDev chat is regularly filled with questions and answers that can already be found on the [TON Overflow](answers.ton.org). But it's a complicated task to know about TON Overflow if you didn't use it before.

That's why creating a Telegram Bot that will share new posts from the TON Overflow to the TonDev chats will help a lot. Thus reducing redundant questions and answers in the chat and making it easier for developers to find solutions to their problems using Google, instead of formulating questions which asked 1000 times before.

### Goals

_Hello._

_We are developing a game project on the blockchain. Every day, tens of thousands of users should receive game tokens for activity in the game. At the moment, the project is implemented on the Solana blockchain and we pay 0.000005 SOL for each issuance of tokens to the user. We implemented the same functionality on the TON blockchain and regretted the fact that each transaction of Tokens to a user costs 0.04-0.06 TON. With such price it's impossible to launch the project on TON blockchain. Tell me, please, are we wrong, or is the transaction of tokens in the TON network really 100 times more expensive than the Solana network?_

We need an article about random number generation in smart contracts.
The article must explain different ways of generating random numbers on-chain and provide some examples.

### Context

This topic is very important. Random numbers are part of many different smart contracts & projects.
There are several ways of acquiring random numbers on-chain, and the basic ones aren't really safe.
TON Hack Challenge demonstrated that here:
 - https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/security/ton-hack-challenge-1#4-lottery

So we need to explain and give some examples about reliable RNG for developers.

open,NX (@nrwl/nx) plugin for bootstrapping TON smart contracts monorepo,"### Summary

I propose to create `nx` plugin for initiating `FunC` libraries in monorepo, with out-of-the-box support for commands such as `build`, `test`, `deploy(?)`.

### Context

[Nx](https://nx.dev/) is one of the most popular monorepo management utilities, which itself uses plugins enabling developers to initiate libraries/apps using predefined, best-practice boilerplates.

Setting up a monorepo with `nx` is as easy as `yarn create nx-workspace` and adding a `node` library for example is as follows `nx generate @nrwl/node:lib`

Nx comes very handy for `CI/CD` as well with its built-in functions like `nx affected`. So essentially having `nx` plugin will 
 help to:
* speed up the dev environment setup
* manage multiple smart contract libraries in single monorepo
* simplify build, testing and  deployment processes

Her is an example of nx plugin I wrote for managing `rust-wasm` libraries: https://github.com/noctifer20/nx-cargo

open,Contract profiler,"### Summary

Contract emulator that can show number of times each instruction is ran and how much gas does it cost.

### Context

Such tool would be useful for optimizing gas usage and therefore would cut down on contract fees.

### Goals

Create crossplatform profiler for TON contracts.

### Deliverables

- Creating program that is able to locally execute transactions and run tests meanwhile measuring gas usage and execution count for each instruction
- Making this program crossplatform
  *preferably without Docker, as Docker claims not to work in nested virtualization, and sometimes TON-related programs have to be ran in a VM*

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Profiler can execute a transaction locally when FunC/Fift/TVM code of contract and transaction data is provided
- [ ] Program can measure gas usage while running contract tests (as toncli new-tests mode)
- [ ] Profiler becomes available on all platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS (preferably without Docker)

Today we lack examples of how to create NFT from the first point to the end using essential infrastructure tools provided by the TON Community and the blockchain community. That's why we need to make tutorials based on inspiring examples with popular technologies.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5148967/206681746-c3707b14-c00d-4f81-bfbb-143238c1fe1a.png)

### Context

I saw an example of building an NFT JS Application in OpenSea using Polygon and Pinata:
* https://medium.com/pinata/how-to-build-an-app-nft-7c57b51698e7

It would be nice to have something like this for the TON Blockchain, as in the future, TON wants to focus on WebApps.

### Goals

* As TON Storage is still in development, we could use Pinata as an IPFS provider example
* Polygon must be changed to TON Blockchain with the relevant SDK (ton.js, tonapi.io, GetGems NFT smart contracts)
* Instead of OpenSea, you will use GetGems marketplace as the most popular gateway for NFTs

Finally, you will write a tutorial for developers who want to create something valuable based on TON and NFTs.

Please, use the [How To Build an App NFT](https://medium.com/pinata/how-to-build-an-app-nft-7c57b51698e7) article as the inspiration for your tutorial.

closed,Rewrite multisig wallet scripts from `.fif` to TypeScript and integrate to the `ton.js` SDK,"### Summary

Multisig wallet is an essential instrument for DAOs, funds, DEXes, communities, and even small partnerships.

While the TON Ecosystem's goal is to reach mass adoption, it's pretty hard to attract partners from other chains without clear instructions on how to use a multi-sig wallet easily.

By this footstep, I dare you to become a game-changer for future partners coming to TON.

### Context

## Where we are

Nowadays, we already have the following:
- [Standard multi-signature wallet smart contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/multisig-contract) with fift scripts to use it
- [Step-by-step tutorial on how to create multi-sig contract](https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/multisig)

Even with these 2 tools, it's still pretty hard to understand why we need so many files, especially for everyone who comes to TON and is scared by the power of the Fift language.

That's why we should rewrite all the tools from Fift to the TypeScript language. This will allow more automation with ton.js SDK. 

### Goals

* Make a multi-sig wallet an essential instrument for every community at TON

### Deliverables

* Rewrite to TypeScript every `.fif` file in ""Standard multi-signature wallet smart contract""
* Add a documentation README file with examples of how to use such scripts
* Add support for the [`ton.js` SDK](https://github.com/ton-core/ton) to improve future integration to the DApps


### Definition of Done

* [x] Every `.fif` file covered by TypeScript analog
* [x] Project is covered with tests
* [x] README file which covers every file with relevant example

We need to change something here.



### Context

Suppose we want to create something attractive for the people from the community (or even for the future community members!) who want to see the network activity, first of all.

* Moreover, here are scripts to get all the metrics from the tonmon.xyz ([GitHub sources](https://github.com/akme/tonmon))

### Questions

**Everyone is welcome to the discussion:**
* Lack of which metrics have you felt personally for the last month in TON Blockchain?
* What examples of eye-catching and pretty exciting dashboards for the network activity do you know?
* Which **non-technical** metrics, from your experience, are essential for the network activity dashboard?

- Current TON Supply
- Current TPS
- TON Gas (TBD)
- Validators amount & stakes (TBD)
- Total Value Secured  (TBD)
- Link to the TON Community Chats (TonDev Chat, TONSC chat, TON twitters)
- QA section (important!)

### Goals

* Discuss and decide what metrics are essential for the TON Network activity from the usual user side
* Decide a final structure of the dashboard with network activity
* Create an eye-catching meme dashboard (make a fork of [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money/) based on their [GitHub](https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney)) with essential metrics that could be shared with people outside of TON to inspire them to go deeper into the TON Blockchain

### Context

There are 10 million downloads of trust wallet. These are the users that may be interested in toncoin, but not holding it yet. This is not the only app that uses wallet-core. Projects that are using wallet-core are trust wallet, coinpaprika, IFWallet, Alice, crypto.com, frontier, belko, pumapay. Also the project is valuable for people who hold toncoin and other cryptocurrencies, but would like to hold everything in single wallet on native blockchains. 

Adding toncoin to wallet-core will enable projects that use it, integrate it faster

### Goals

The problem addressed is having toncoin on different wallets used by people.
The success metric for the project is merged pull request in wallet-core repository
https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core

There should be ability to receive and send toncoin

### Deliverables

There is already an everscale support which can be used as a reference https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core/pull/2428 However there are differences between everscale and toncoin from ton foundation as the projects develop independently.

What needs to be done:

 - Highlight common code for Ton and Everscale in a separate entity
 - Change the everscale code so that it uses the common code and makes sure everything works
 - Write code for ton
 - Check and fix the performance on the tone:
   - Parsing serialization and deserialization addresses (address.cpp)
   - Cell, cell slice, cell builder
   - Getting an address from a wallet (purse) code
   - Serialization and dereserialization of transfer messages (signer)
 - Add to registry, generate code and write for this test:
   - Add the coin definition to registry.json.
   - Execute codegen/bin/newcoin <coinid>.
   - Execute tools/generate files.
   - Add a coin manager to src/Coin.cpp.
   - Create tests in the file tests/Xxx/TWCoinTypeTests.cpp.
 - Add C interface to src/interface
 - Write tests
   - Getting an address phrase from a seed
   - Mainnet signature tests
   - Tests for TWAnyAddress and TWAnySigner in the interface
   - Generate code for ios and android and crash (apparently there may be problems) and write integration tests for this code
   - Extensive tests in swift and kotlin including the files CoinAddressDerivationTests.cpp, CoinAddressValidationTests.cpp, TWHRPTests.cpp, CoinAddressDerivationTests.kt, CoinAddressDerivationTests.swift and others
 - Pass the integration tests, the code review, correct the comments and merge the pull request

open,Deterministic subaccounts,"### Summary

This proposal introduces a standard way to create privacy-preserving subaccounts for a given _wallet seed_ (aka _mnemonic_).

Subaccounts are created using a mix of a mnemonic + account number. This means the resulting public keys and wallet addresses are indistinguishable from random.

#### Gist

This is the current implementation of the mnemonic-to-seed conversion.

```
  ...
  const entropy = await mnemonicToEntropy(mnemonicArray, password);
  const seed_level0 = await pbkdf2Sha512(entropy, 'TON default seed', PBKDF_ITERATIONS);
  ... // Ed25519 key generation
```

We propose subaccounts as a recursive definition of 512-bit string into 512-bit string:

```
seed_level_1 = await pbkdf2Sha512(seed_level0, account_label, 1);
... // further derivation OR Ed25519 key generation
```

As a convention, account label must be a monotonically growing integer to make on-chain discovery of the used accounts easy when restoring a wallet from the seed. The author of the spec should choose a sensible encoding for that integer (e.g. 32bit LE)

#### Limitations

Comparing to Bitcoin, this is a subset of [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) aimed at _hardened_ keys only. 

Ed25519 is notoriously a non-linear protocol, so creating a non-hardened version is going to be [quite annoying](https://input-output-hk.github.io/adrestia/static/Ed25519_BIP.pdf). Also, we don't really need this in TON at this moment because a lot of applications are built around the idea of reusing the wallet address and breaking away from this model is going to be a giant PITA.

### Context

Users who manage a number of assets for different purposes need to generate multiple wallets and switch between them. Each time a new wallet is generated, it needs to be backed up separately. We need a solution that lets create multiple independent wallets as _subaccounts_ without redoing the work of backing things up.


### Goals

This proposal improves usability and privacy of multi-wallet scenarios for all TON users.

### Deliverables

* A specification;
* Reference implementation in JS / TypeScript;
* Possibly implementations in Go, Kotlin and Swift.

### Definition of Done

- [ ] TEP created
- [ ] Tonweb-mnemonic or tonweb / ton-x extended with support for subaccounts

We should consider extensions to Go, Kotlin, and Swift libraries as well.

open,Authorized-Controllable Tokens,"### Summary

Tokens that can be controlled by multiple parties without listing all those parties in token's contract (to decrease fees.

### Context

There are cases when the right of controlling NFT or jettons has to be granted to some smart-contract, but logically the token owner remains same. For example, in P2P exchanges without intermediaries people may wish to transfer their tokens not instantly but with some delay; in this case they may schedule a message on timer, but then they need to make token trust the timer. Transferring tokens to timer's contract is not safe because if timer breaks, token will become inaccessible.

### Goals

I propose to create a new standard: ACT. Token owner would send an authorization message (its structure needs to be decided) to smart-contract he allows to control the token; when that smart-contract needs to send a message to token, it sends it along with Merkle proof of existence of that authorization message.

### Deliverables

- [ ] create format of authorization and deauthorization messages
- [ ] decide how authorized contract would create Merkle proof
- [ ] solve problems with Merkle proof creating in FunC, possibly write a documentation page for that
- [ ] create sample AC (_authorized-controllable_) NFT
- [ ] create sample AC jetton
- [ ] propose a TEP

### Definition of Done

- [ ] TEP created
- [ ] TEP merged
- [ ] A jetton or any NFT in mainnet is _authorized-controllable_

open,TON Timer,"### Summary

Timer smart-contract built natively on TON _without any external messaging_ that will allow users of The Open Network to schedule messages to some time in future.

### Context

This service can be used by NFT creators to run presales and auctions reliably, or by DAOs wishing to conduct some elections or collect votes on a proposal (limiting token holders' time to vote but not forcing everyone to make decision).

Program sending external messages can break at any time (for example, if network connection is lost); this timer is going to work as long as TON itself.

There will be possibility to deploy one's own timer contract - for example, for purposes of debugging message chains (so others' messages don't fill up transactions list), or if other contracts almost run out of gas when trying to process messages. As the deployer is the one filling up contract's balance, ones who join the existing timer give that person a small reward.

### Goals

Allow TON users to schedule arbitrary messages to some time in future.

### Deliverables

- [x] Simple scheduler contract (storing all messages in single contract; similar to https://github.com/EmelyanenkoK/ton_scheduler, but written myself) able to transfer user-specified amount of TON with arbitrary payload, pausing when it doesn't have any messages remaining
  `EQDpVsvhlIxDGO3qZtPfrChaiKzlkVt6Rs-6J4Xd8BKIgQK7`
  `schedule#_ fwd_nton:uint64 time:uint32 dest:^MsgAddressInt body:^Any = Msg;`
- [x] Purchasing domain for timer (`stabletimer.ton` on mainnet)
- [x] Implementing multi-message timer with ability to schedule several messages to a single moment of time
- [x] Implementing algorithm for price calculation (that is, storage fee, scheduling cost and reward to the bell deployer)
- [ ] Web UI for interacting with existing timers and deploying new ones

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Timer source code published and possibly transferred to TON repository
- [ ] Example timer deployed and working (no messages handled incorrectly because of timer bugs within 3 days of launch)
- [ ] Web interface for scheduling messages available
- [ ] Integration/ability to construct common messages like token transfers/ability to parse ton:// transfer link and convert that into message to timer

Create a service for decentralized on-chain cheques

### Context

Cheques are a popular and in-demand feature. People use them every day for different purposes.
But the problem is that all existing services for cheques are centralized and usually hosted on Telegram bots. People can't be sure that their coins are safe and nobody from the administration of the service will claim it. Centralization also means that user must hold coins on service's wallet so there are risks of losing funds in case of some hack or attack on a service.
Another problem of centralized cheques is that they usually don't work with custom tokens (Jettons or NFTs), or even if they do, the Jetton must be listed on their service in order to be used.

Decentralized and secure cheques built on-chain would solve these problems, while still remaining easy-to-use and cheap.

### Goals

 * Come up with the implementation of on-chain cheques
 * Develop smart contract and user-friendly frontend

### Deliverables

 * Smart contract for on-chain cheques

open,Develop a universally adopted wrapped Toncoin (wTON),"### Summary

We are developing a wrapped Toncoin (wTON) in a jetton format, which will serve as a universal intermediary for exchanging TON-based jettons (tokens) in any trading pairs on TON-based DEXs, and will be used in other TON-based applications.

Our next (and big) goal is not only to program a wTON smart contract, but to create the wTON everyone is happy with.

The benefits of a universally adopted wTON (compared to lots of different wTONs, which have been already created and/or will be created in the future) are as follows:

- Consensus of interested participants
- No financial risks for the end users (e.g. avoid other wTONs which might be scam ones)
- No ecosystem fragmentation
- A single standard API and a single standard set of features


### Context

Implementation of a wrapped TON contract doesn't require a lot of effort. As a matter of fact, several implementations already exist. The problem is that numerous different wTONs created by different developers bare lots of risks:

- **Financial risks:** there is no guarantee that a particular wTON doesn't hold security vulnerabilities left deliberately or by mistake. Getting security audits and certifications of the same quality for all the many wTONs is unrealistic.
- **Ecosystem fragmentation and no single API:** this is a real problem for developers who are building products that will have to use a variety of wTONs. Imagine a wallet developer who wants to correctly display the total amount of wTON, including regular and all kinds of wrapped ones.
- **No parity of features:** each wTON will have its own unique set of features, which will lead to additional hassle with support.

The solution could be a standard, universally adopted, audited and certified wTON with a set of features that fits the needs of most developers. Of course, it won't prevent creating other wrapped TON contracts, but most likely developers will prefer to use a widely used, universally adopted and community-led wTON if there is one.


We have already implemented these features:

- Wrap/unwrap functionality
- Conformance to Fungible Token Standard TIP-74


### Goals

To create wrapped Toncoin, which will serve as a universal intermediary for exchanging TON-based jettons (tokens) in any trading pairs on TON-based DEXs, and will be used in other TON-based applications.

Our next (and big) goal is not only to program a wTON smart contract, but to create the wTON everyone is happy with.

### Deliverables

Source code which will include these features:
- Custom payload for minting/burning transactions.
- Support for query_id parameter similar to TEP-74.
- Better gas management via reserves which will allow not to use any hardcoded fees in the code.

open,Jetton migrations (for discoverable jettons and future standard upgrades),"### Summary

Provide a migration path for jettons to new contracts.

### Context

[TEP-89](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md) introduced discoverable jetton minters.
This means that previously deployed jettons are not discoverable and have to deploy an [auxiliary contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-discovery.fc) for adding such capability.
We suggest to support a migration path such that non-discoverable jettons can be migrated to a new (discoverable) minter.

Such a migration solution will also serve further extensions to the jetton protocol in the future.

#### Suggested Flow
A migration contract will be deployed such that it is linked to a certain minter contract. 
Holders of the outdated jetton can send their jettons to the migration contract and receive new jettons instead.

### Goals

Come up with a full solution to the migration path, including a contract interface & implementation as well as a UI.


### Deliverables

* A PR to jetton.live with UI operating the migration (https://github.com/ton-defi-org/jetton-deployer-webclient)
* Documentation stating out the solution logic. Attack vectors should be specified and resolved.
* TL-B schemas for operations and storage
* Github repo with contract (latest stable func version using latest syntax)
* Full tests (typescript, sandbox)
* Full blueprint-style contract wrapper
* Code for deploying the contract (typescript)

### Technical instructions
* Compiles under func 0.4.1
* Uses latest syntax: consts, include and pragma directives
* Opcodes are CRC32 hashes
* Gas-efficient
* 100% Test coverage (using sandbox)

closed,Burn NFTs — Smart contract,"### Summary

Spam is a hard problem to solve. Bad actors are taking advantage of TON's low transaction fees to exploit iconic mechanics of web3, such as NFT airdrops.

These unwanted NFTs often claim to give users a free gift/NFT if they click a link in the description. Clicking the link leads the users to a site where typically one of two things happen:
1. Users are asked to approve a transaction to “mint” or “claim” a free NFT, but instead they lose their funds.
2. They are asked to input their seed phrase, which results in a total loss of funds.

These scams are becoming increasingly more sophisticated. For instance, after a contract address and domain is identified as malicious, scammers can change the metadata of an NFT. It can feel like an endless game of whack-a-mole, but one we’re committed to winning.

open,Series of videos on TON programming,"### Summary

Let's be honest - to get into TON programming is quite a hustle. Documentation is great, but there is lack of hands-on tutorials and ""speaking heads"" when it comes to programming meaningful smartcontracts, NFTs or dApps for TON. I'm on my learning path, but I've decided to walk the extra mile and produce media content from my learning process. I will plan, produce and distribute a series of videos along with text tutorials that will get a new-comer into this programming field. 

### Context

I'm quite an experienced developer in classical fields like backend and frontend developments. However, learning to program for TON is quite hard for me. I want to make this much more friendly. I'm also a person who needs to see the whole process end-to-end in order to make the first steps. Recording my footsteps into an organized series of materials can be a great resource for the community.

### Goals

* record a series of tutorial videos with outlining all the moments that are not clear for me in the process
* organise Q&A sessions with experienced developers and record our conversations to provide new-comers with ready-made answers
* produce text tutorials based on those videos, to equip those who are more reading type of people

### Deliverables

**Self-onboarding series (currently planning on 10 videos)**
In this series of videos, every video will contain a tutorial on a certain topic that I’ve recently learned as well as rising the questions that I’ve encountered during the learning process. Each tutorial video will be then followed by a Q&A session video with some experienced TON developer from the community, who will answer the questions and guide me further.
Average video length - 60-70 mins.
Every video tutorial is going to have a text version published on [Medium.com](http://medium.com/)

1. **Environment setup & first “Hello world” smart contract** based on https://github.com/romanovichim/TonFunClessons_Eng 
[Video is already published [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbIt8bjvvjE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbIt8bjvvjE)]
    \+ video Q&A with a pro smart contracts developer
    [Script is ready. Negotiating a Q&A session with Narek Abovyan from TonTech]
2. **Programming a simple smartcontract with the tonstarter-contracts (TypeSript) approach**
In this video I will program a simple smartcontract and write a number of tests for it.
     \+ video Q&A with a pro - Agreed to have a call with Tal Kol as he is an ambassador of this approach.
3. **Programming a dApp that will interact with a simple smartcontract from browser** [as an example I can provide another video I've published on programming a TonHub extension - [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0guNekn-6z4&t=195s)
     \+ video Q&A with a pro 
4. **Programming a ReactNative application that interacts with TON smartcontract**
This video is different from 3rd one, because I want to outline that Web3 is not just browser, but can also involve a mobile application. Will be helpfull as I’m going to overview known libraries for RN.
     \+ video Q&A with a pro
5. **Setting up own API instance of communicating with TON blockchain.**
     \+ video Q&A with a pro

I plan to prepare and publish 1-2 videos per week. So overall project might take 2-3 months to finish.

**Contentful series (currently planning on 5 videos)**

As oppose to the Self-onboarding series, Contenfull videos are going to be much shorter (20-30 min) and each video is going to cover very focused information on specific topic. The content of this video will be basically a mix of what I’ve learned by myself and what I’ve learned from pro TON developers during Q&A sessions.

**1. TypeScript vs ton-cli approaches**
Pros & Cons, Resources, Tools

**2. Authentification for dApps**
TonHub, TonKeeper

**3. Writing tests for TON smartcontracts**

### Definition of Done

15 videos according to topics announced in the Deliverables block, published on YouTube with text versions published on Medium.com and Dev.to

### Reward

I'm setting up an expected reward based on my workload and salary at my main full-time job.

Preparing a single video takes me 1.5-3 days. I make approx. $ 200 / day at my job.
I think to count for example $300 (in TON equivalent) per video. $300 * 15 videos = $4,500. And of course we divide this by 3 as I'll deliver this over 3 months maximum.

So I would round it up to 4000 TONs ($5600 if the rate is $1.4/TON) then I could buy a good microphone, webcam and light, to provide a better quality of videos. But I'm open to your offers.

Suggested milestones:
1. 5 videos by November 1 - $1500
2. 5 videos by December 1 - $1500
3. 5 videos by January 1 - $2600

All the videos will be produced and published in the order according to the list order above.

closed,Verifier Registry smart contract,"### Summary
Write a smart contract (""Verifier Registry"") for forwarding signed messages to other contracts

### Context
We run computations on off-chain nodes that produce data which needs to be stored on chain in various contracts.
In order for these contracts to accept the data, they require it to be signed by the off-chain nodes, each of which has a public/private keypair.
The verifier registry holds the list of keypairs and verifies signatures of arbitrary data passed on to the contracts downstream.

#### Flow
* An entity stakes a certain amount (10K TON) in the verifier registry contract, for which it receives the ability to store its verify configuration (node addresses, public keys for verification, multi-sig threshold)
* Once the configuration is in place, the entity can send a signed message and an address to forward the message to.
* The verifier contracts checks the signatures and forwards the message

Detailed spec can be found [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/shaharyakir/75696bcff45b0a93cc5c9d464bf7ee60)

### Goals
Develop a smart contract (""Verifier Registry"") for forwarding signed messages to other contracts

### Deliverables

* Full tests (typescript, tvm-contract-executor)
* Code for deploying the contract (typescript)

### Definition of Done

TON Dev Chat has many questions and complaints about smart-contract binaries (func, fift, lite-client). On every system binaries need their setup and dependencies to work appropriately (Windows, Debian, Ubuntu, MacOS x86, MacOS arm64). That provides complexity and tons of questions for new developers in the ecosystem and lower conversion to future smart-contracts developers.

Tal Kol already simplified the process with [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-binaries). But it is still not enough to make your ""first smart contract in one evening"". If TON wants to provide a first-class experience for developers the process should be as simple as possible.

Tal Kol's experience could be used to make the releases versioning to split versions of TON binaries used by the one-line installer in the future. But today we could start from the MVP of the one-line installer.

closed,Library for handling blockchain data,"### Summary

Library that would be essential for TON projects that need production ready solution to index TON blockchain.

### Context

When it comes to working with data from the blockchain and you need a some way to store, parse, subscribe to a blocks, a transactions, a messages then your choices are pretty limited.  

Here's the ways (at least the ones that I found):
1. Start your own Liteserver
2. Connect to one of the existing Liteservers
3. Use one of the free services like [TON HTTP API](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api)  

The first option is not really an option for most of the developers. Cause you need to run a full node which you need to maintain and infrastructure costs are not cheap.  
The second option's major drawback is that you need to trust the Liteserver you're connecting to. And service provider need to scale their infrastructure to support all the users.   
And same goes for the third option. You need to trust the service you're using and service provider need to scale their infrastructure to support all the users.

That kind of problem faced by a team from [Pagoda Indexer](https://near-indexers.io/) from [NEAR ecosystem](https://near.org/ecosystem).  

And they came up with a solution which involves [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and consists of a pair of libraries: [NEAR Lake Indexer](https://near-indexers.io/docs/projects/near-lake-indexer) and [NEAR Lake Framework](https://near-indexers.io/docs/projects/near-lake-framework).  

[NEAR Lake Indexer](https://near-indexers.io/docs/projects/near-lake-indexer) is a library that allows you to connect to the blockchain and store the data in [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).  
[NEAR Lake Framework](https://near-indexers.io/docs/projects/near-lake-framework) is a library companion to [NEAR Lake Indexer](https://near-indexers.io/docs/projects/near-lake-indexer) that allows you to connect to the [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and parse the data.

What got me interested in this solution is that availability is handled by [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and with [Requester Pays option](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RequesterPaysExamples.html) cost would be fixated for the provider and end users by would pay by themselves for the data they're using.

### Goals

* Provide a fundamental library for future (or existing) TON projects that would need to store and parse blockchain data

### Deliverables

* Create a library that would allow to connect to the blockchain (Liteserver) and store the data in [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

### Survivorship bias problem

Right now, we have a big problem with newcomers that wants to start developing on TON. 

I surveyed the community of ~5000 devs in four chats in June. And I got around 40 responses. But every one of those responses is from someone who has passed a series of hurdles and becomes a developer in the ecosystem. Even from these heroes, the most common problem I've heard of was ""documentation.""

Feel free to read the answers here:
* https://workflowy.com/s/ton-builders-read-on/FFpB7q4NvpqndwO5

And how many of these unfortunate souls didn't pass and settle in as dead listeners in dev chats? We don't know.

All who came from the development fields said where they have pain and what they need to fix. And how many of those people didn't come and were swept away by the complexity of the current TON ecosystem?

open,Improving FunC - OpenZeppelin like libraries for easier common abstractions,"### Summary

In its current form, there's no argument that FunC is difficult to work with. One of the primary reasons it's difficult for new developers is that its standard library is very low level and doesn't provide enough abstractions. This can be solved by creating a set of reusable libraries in FunC that will provide developers with common contract services with simple API. Think of these as optional extensions to the standard FunC library.

This concept is not new. In the Ethereum ecosystem https://www.openzeppelin.com/ provides a very similar service. Whenever a Solidity developer needs to implement some complex pattern, such as proxy contract for supporting code upgrades, they would not try to implement this from scratch. They would simply go to OpenZepplin, download a [ready-made library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy) in Solidity that contains the complex implementation and embed it in their project. You can say that OpenZeppelin abstracts away the complexities of the proxy pattern by wrapping it with simpler API.

We can do the same for common tasks that are complicated in FunC.

### Context

There's a common complaint in the TON ecosystem that FunC is too complicated. I see many developers comparing it to Solidity and asking why has TON chosen such a complex language for its smart contracts. To be honest, I disagree with this claim. FunC is not much more complicated than Solidity. I believe new developers get this feeling just because the FunC ecosystem is immature and this can be heavily improved by adding a few footsteps. This one for example.

I saw a proposal in the community to dance around FunC by creating a transpiler from JavaScript or Python to FunC that will allow new developers to write their smart contracts in ""easy languages"" like JavaScript and Python instead. Will such an idea really make contract development on TON much easier? I don't think so. FunC syntax is pretty much identical to regular C, and JavaScript syntax was taken from C as well. I don't think this is where the complexity comes from.

A lot of the complexity comes from the lack of abstractions in FunC. Consider the code needed to check if an incoming internal message is a bounced message:

```
int flags = cs~load_uint(4); ;; int_msg_info$0 ihr_disabled:Bool bounce:Bool bounced:Bool
if (flags & 1) {
    ;; handle bounced message here
}
```

In most contracts this piece of code appears as is, here's an example from [Jetton official standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/2c13d3ef61ca4288293ad65bf0cfeaed83879b93/ft/jetton-minter.fc#L46). What is a new developer supposed to understand from looking at this code?

Now imagine that there was a FunC common library for parsing internal messages with abstracted API that looks like this:

```
int flags = parse_message_flags(cs);
if (is_bounced(flags)) {
  ;; handle bounced message here
}
```

This would be so much easier to understand, because all the non-interesting implementation details like the const values of the flags or the bit structure of the incoming message are hidden away inside the library.

Now I'm pretty experienced with FunC and when I look at code that looks like [this](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/2c13d3ef61ca4288293ad65bf0cfeaed83879b93/ft/jetton-minter.fc#L33), I can't do much except scratch my head in wonder. WTF. This is not because FunC is complicated. It's because there are bunch of abstractions missing and I'm looking at internal encoding of messages that I don't really care about as a ""regular"" developer.

Abstractions are not a new idea. When we implemented [TonWeb](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb), we put a lot of abstractions in place to create readable API and hide message encoding details from most developers. Here's an [example](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/80640625aad2b6ec65f34a5b0fb824df27020d33/src/contract/wallet/WalletContract.js#L172).

### Goals

* Review existing FunC contracts and look for repeating complex patterns that are candidates for abstraction.
* Divide these patterns into families - for example one family can be message encoding.
* Create a collection of FunC libraries that developers can import into their code for performing basic tasks in each family.
* The libraries will abstract away implementation details (like how the messages are actually encoded) and help developers focus on the major things such as their own logic.
* Create an environment where developers could collaborate on improving these libraries since the community will need to develop them together. This can even be a GitHub repo dedicated for the purpose on the official TON GitHub org. Since these libraries will be used in smart contracts, changes will have to be reviewed by our best FunC experts.
* Make these libraries easy to learn with proper documentation.

### Deliverables

* An initial set of FunC importable libraries for different common topics.
* Simple and easy to understand API that abstracts away the complex implementation details.
* A place where these libraries are published and maintained.
* PRs to take some of our common contracts (like Jetton, NFT) and make them rely on the libraries instead to simplify their existing code.

open,Decenralized Oracles system,"### Summary

A blockchain is designed to work extremely efficiently with its own internal data but is unaware of external data such as real world exchange rates, or other data not on the blockchain. 

### Context

A blockchain cannot retrieve data from an external API, due to its internal processes. If nodes address an external API at different times, they may get different results and will never be able to reach consensus, since it is unclear which of these nodes should be trusted.

To resolve this issue, instead of the “pull” model (in which a blockchain reaches out to the real world for data) we can use the “push” model. Data suppliers write data to the blockchain for decentralized apps (dApps) to use.

Entities that save data to the blockchain are called blockchain oracles. But the problem is that all of them operate in a centralized way since they need to trust a single source of data. Overall, a system is only as decentralized as its most centralized element. Therefore, a decentralized app that uses data from a single oracle to make key decisions is in fact, highly centralized. Logically, by influencing the behavior of just one component, the oracle, you can influence the behavior of the entire app.

The idea of a decentralized oracle is an attractive solution, but there is no easy way to implement it.

Here are some solutions on how this issue could be resolved. 

### Goals

dAPP and smart-contracts

Simplest solution: multi-signature

The easiest solution is a multi-signature approach. Several users reach consensus and sign the same data. For instance, let’s say we want to receive data about the USD/EUR exchange rate and we have five oracles that need to agree on a consensus value (from outside the blockchain), sign the relevant transaction and send it to a blockchain account that will only accept it if it includes at least three signatures out of five.

But this approach has several issues:

If the oracles fail to reach consensus, the data simply won’t be sent to the blockchain
Data suppliers have no financial motivation
The oracle list is predetermined and limited.
To resolve these issues, we need to build a fully-fledged decentralized app, which operates as a marketplace for two kinds of participants:

Apps that need data

Oracles that can supply data for a reward.
Let’s formulate the main requirements for such a dApp and implement it using FUNC and the TON blockchain.

###   Requirements 

**OracleRepresenter**

A contract, which would be deployed by the service provider and would store ""calculation result"".

**Rules**

Contract can be in one of the five phases: idle, supply, showdown, calculation, rewarding

Phases can circulate or not

**OracleParticipant** would be rewarded depending on how far they from ""calculation result""

**OracleParticipant**

A contract, which can deployed by anyone who wants to participate in future calculations.

**Rules**

Would be tied to the specific **OracleRepresenter**, meaning it can participate in calculations for the specified **OracleRepresenter**

In supply phase it should provide hash of the value

In showdown phase it should provide the actual value

open,Article: How to manage your contract gas,"### Summary

Teach FunC smart contract developers how to manage gas in the contracts they're writing.

### Context

TON contract gas model is very unique and quite different from the EVM model. Contract developers must design a gas strategy. If they won't do this well, the contract can run out of TON balance for rent and be removed. Messages that the contract sends might not have enough gas and be rejected. This is an advanced topic, not an introductory one.

### Goals

* Help FunC developers write better smart contracts.
* Help FunC developers avoid gas handling mistakes in their code.
* Target audience - experienced FunC developers that already know FunC basics.
* Help teams that are actively working on contracts mature faster and become production ready.

### Deliverables

A markdown article in a form of a GitHub gist or GitHub repository

### Definition of Done

* A well-written article about the general idea and motivation behind TON's gas model for smart contracts.
* Article lists pit falls where developers can make a gas mistake and render their contract un-usable.
* Article gives best practices (do's and don'ts) for handling gas in FunC. Example: How much balance should be left for paying rent (storage fees)? How are storage fees calculated and what is the storage fee per cell per year.
* Article shows all of the above in practice with multiple hands-on code examples.
