How to get a GitHub Access Token

The GitHub Access Token is a unique code used to authorize access to your repositories and other GitHub resources. It can be obtained in a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Go to your GitHub profile settings
- Go to the GitHub site and log in to your account.
- Click on your avatar in the top right corner of the screen and select Settings.

## Step 2: Choose settings to get an Access Token
- On the settings page, select the "Developer settings" tab.
- On the menu that appears, select "Personal access tokens.

## Step 3: Create a new token
- Click on the "Generate new token" button.
- Select the necessary permissions for the token (read, write, delete, etc.).
- Click on the "Generate token" button.
- Copy the generated token to a safe place. Please note that after closing the window, the token will no longer appear.

You can now use your Access Token to authorize access to repositories and other GitHub resources. To use it, add it as a value for the "access_token" parameter in your GitHub API requests.
