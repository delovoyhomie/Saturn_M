How to get a GitHub Access Token

The GitHub Access Token is a unique code used to authorize access to your repositories and other GitHub resources. It can be obtained in a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Go to your GitHub profile settings
1. Go to the GitHub site and log in to your account.
2. Click on your avatar in the top right corner of the screen and select Settings.

## Step 2: Choose settings to get an Access Token
1. On the settings page, select the "Developer settings" tab.
2. On the menu that appears, select "Personal access tokens.

## Step 3: Create a new token
1. Click on the "Generate new token" button.
2. Select the necessary permissions for the token (read, write, delete, etc.).
3. Click on the "Generate token" button.
4. Copy the generated token to a safe place. Please note that after closing the window, the token will no longer appear.

You can now use your Access Token to authorize access to repositories and other GitHub resources. To use it, add it as a value for the "access_token" parameter in your GitHub API requests.

# Security (access data)
To set the access_token, owner, and repo variables as environment variables, you can use the os module in Python.
Here's an example:

- Create a new file called .env in the root directory of your project.
- Add the following lines to the .env file:
```
export access_token='your-token'
export owner='delovoyhomie'
export repo='ton-footsteps'
```
Save the ".env" file.

Now you can use these variables in your code to avoid hard coding values. For example, you can use them in your Python code as follows:
```
import os

access_token = os.environ['access_token']
owner = os.environ['owner']
repo = os.environ['repo']
```

Here we have used the Python library "os" to access environment variables. The function "os.environ['variable_name']" is used to get the value of the variable.

# How to use it?
## For what?
Visualization and data collection can help you learn which community members contribute the most to the project. This can help project leaders determine who needs encouragement and who can help develop the project. Visualization and data collection can also help track project development, including the frequency and volume of code changes, the number of open and closed issues, growth in the number of participants, etc. This can help project leaders understand where the project is going and make evidence-based decisions. 
## Tutorial 
### Functions for getting data
Run get_contributors(), get_issues(), get_pulls(), and average_time_isseu() to get the information you need. For example:
```
get_contributors()
get_issues()
get_pulls()
average_time_isseu()
```

After you run the features, you'll get information about your repository, such as the number of participants, the number of issues and change requests, and the average time to resolve issues. Interpret the results to understand the community's contribution to the project and the effectiveness of working on problems.

### Info 
#### get_contributors()
Get's information about contributors to the project on GitHub and displays statistics about the number of regular and active contributors, as well as the total number of commits from community members.

#### get_issues()
Get's information about all tasks (issues) of the project on GitHub and displays statistics about the number of open and closed tasks.


#### get_pulls()
Get's information about all pull requests of the project on GitHub and displays statistics about the number of pull requests.

#### average_time_isseu()
Get's information about the solution time of project tasks on GitHub and outputs the average solution time in days.

### Plotting data
The plot_contributors() function uses the GitHub API to retrieve data on contributors to the repository, specifically their total number of commits. It then plots this data in a bar graph using the plotly library.

The plot_issues() function retrieves data on all issues in the repository, both open and closed, and plots this data in several different graphs using the plotly and pandas libraries. The graphs include a pie chart comparing the number of open and closed issues, a histogram showing the distribution of days for open issues, a histogram showing the distribution of days it took to close issues, and two line graphs showing the number of open and closed issues over time.

The plot_pulls() function is similar to plot_issues(), but retrieves data on pull requests instead. It plots a pie chart comparing the number of open and closed pull requests using the plotly library.

The issues_x_pulls() function retrieves data on both issues and pull requests and plots this data in a bar graph using the plotly library.

The viz_contributors() function retrieves data on the weekly contributions of each contributor to the repository and plots this data in a line graph using the plotly library.
